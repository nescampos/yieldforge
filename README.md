# YieldForge
YieldForge is a functional protocol, deployed on Andromeda, using aOS and ADOs to develop and deploy the protocol.

YieldForge's goal is to transform future yields (staking rewards, LP fees, etc.) into liquid, tradable assets through transparent blockchain auctions. YieldForge seek to offer users a way to unlock early liquidity, incentivize prediction markets, and democratize access to complex DeFi products through automation, interoperability, and AI.

## Technical Implementation
### Modular Architecture with ADOs

|Module|ADO|Description|
|----------|:--------:|---------:|
|Yield Tokenization|CW20|Represents future rights to rewards.|
|Auction|Curve, and Auction(possibly if I use NFT)|Dynamic bidding with predictable price curves.|
|Temporal distribution|Vesting / Lockdrop|Gradual access to acquired returns.|
|Secondary Market|Exchange|Free purchase/sale of yield tokens|

## Template for App Builder

Available in [the template file](./app-YieldForge-staging.flex)

### Process Flow

- Yield providers tokenize their projected yield in CW20.
- An automated auction is triggered using ADO Auction, with a price curve adjusted via ADO Curve.
- Buyers receive the YieldToken, the reward of which is gradually unlocked through ADO Vesting.
- Tokens can be traded on a secondary market while awaiting full yield release.

### Possible use with AI

Predictive Price AI: Adjusts auction curves based on volume, risk, and demand.
Yield Segmentation: Divides yield into portions for different profiles (high risk, low risk).

## Use cases
- Early liquidity for stakers without breaking lockups.
- DeFi derivatives market accessible to non-technical users.
- Trading algorithms that buy future yields based on risk analysis.
- Monetization of projected returns between DAOs and communities.


## Future Development

- [ ] Create a simple user interface that displays an AI-simulated yield curve
- [ ] Expand the protocol into a DAO that collectively manages yield
- [ ] Integrate with protocols for cross-chain yield
- [ ] Train custom AI models with real-world yield data to improve predictions
